this website is a site for anime lovers and also people new to anime 
being a admirer of the industry it inspired me to build this website for the first assignment

the website has a navigation bar pinnde at the beginning of the page
it follows with two images and some intro message
next is a tabl to provide some info
then there is a button to give an idea about the imdb ratings of various anime
then there is a audio file followed by three videos
then there is a summary section with some text
then comes the contact us section with a form with attributes name email and review
then there is the mailto tag to mail me directly

then in the footer
we have three section where there are phone call to tag, message sms tag, two urls to instagram and youtube, and finally an embedded map pointing to the university.

the website is responsive to a great extent and i tried doing it completely with html css.
